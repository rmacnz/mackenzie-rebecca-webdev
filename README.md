Updated for: Assignment 1
Information requested for assignment 1:

Say something about yourself:
My name is Rebecca MacKenzie and I am a first year graduate student here at Northeastern. I got my undergraduate degree at Northeastern (graduated May 2016) and am now working full time at Northeastern as a course coordinator for Fundamentals of Computer Science. During my time as an undergraduate student I had three co-ops, two of which were in web development. However, I worked mainly on the back end so I am hoping to learn a bit about front end development and databases as well as how to pull everything together.

Purpose of the repository:
This repository will contain my work for CS5610 - Web Development with Professor Vidoje Mihajlovikj

QUESTIONS ABOUT ASSIGNMENT 3:
- For the services, the code online does not match the template given in the assignment (var api={} is not included in the online code and instead each
  variable is set on its own). Which format should I follow?
- One part of the assignment seems to suggest that we should have a file called website.controller.client.js but the other seems to suggest that we should split this up into three different controllers (for website-list, website-new, and website-edit). Which is it? This same problem occurs for pages and widgets. I have split mine up for websites because that's what you did but I am not sure this is correct so I have not figured out what to do for the pages and widgets.

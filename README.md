Information requested for assignment 1:

Say something about yourself:
My name is Rebecca MacKenzie and I am a first year graduate student here at Northeastern. I got my undergraduate degree at Northeastern (graduated May 2016) and am now working full time at Northeastern as a course coordinator for Fundamentals of Computer Science. During my time as an undergraduate student I had three co-ops, two of which were in web development. However, I worked mainly on the back end so I am hoping to learn a bit about front end development and databases as well as how to pull everything together.

Purpose of the repository:
This repository will contain my work for CS5610 - Web Development with Professor Vidoje Mihajlovikj

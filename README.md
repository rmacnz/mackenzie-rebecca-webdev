Updated for: Assignment 1
Information requested for assignment 1:

Say something about yourself:
My name is Rebecca MacKenzie and I am a first year graduate student here at Northeastern. I got my undergraduate degree at Northeastern (graduated May 2016) and am now working full time at Northeastern as a course coordinator for Fundamentals of Computer Science. During my time as an undergraduate student I had three co-ops, two of which were in web development. However, I worked mainly on the back end so I am hoping to learn a bit about front end development and databases as well as how to pull everything together.

Purpose of the repository:
This repository will contain my work for CS5610 - Web Development with Professor Vidoje Mihajlovikj

Questions about Assignment 2 (Sent to prof)
1. In widget-heading should the "Text" input field be 3 rows? It doesn't look this way in the example but it seems like that would be a more reasonable input type for long text.
2. In widget-image where should I navigate to if you click "Upload Image" button?
3. In widget-image how do I display the width as a percentage (I could just do a text box but this seems like cheating since I only want to be able to input number values).
4. How do I do the sidebar things?
6. How do I do the widget-list page overlapping cogs? What does the triple line thing go to?
8. In website-new there is a + button displayed in the landscape version. What should this do since you are already on the "add new website" page? Just direct you to the same page you are already on?

9. For some reason my form is going off to the right too far when I use the grid system (website-new.html)
10. How do I make the row for a grid system full height? I want the line to extend all the way down.


Specifications not mentioned in assignment 2
1. Homepage can look any way you want.
2. Profile page username box can be readonly or not. Doesn't matter.

Information requested for assignment 1:

Say something about yourself:
My name is Rebecca MacKenzie and I am a first year graduate student here at Northeastern. I got my undergraduate degree at Northeastern (graduated May 2016) and am now working full time at Northeastern as a course coordinator for Fundamentals of Computer Science. During my time as an undergraduate student I had three co-ops, two of which were in web development. However, I worked mainly on the back end so I am hoping to learn a bit about front end development and databases as well as how to pull everything together.

Purpose of the repository:
This repository will contain my work for CS5610 - Web Development with Professor Vidoje Mihajlovikj

Questions about Assignment 2
1. In widget-heading should the "Text" input field be 3 rows? It doesn't look this way in the example but it seems like that would be a more reasonable input type for long text.
2. In widget-image where should I navigate to if you click "Upload Image" button?
3. In widget-image how do I display the width as a percentage (I could just do a text box but this seems like cheating since I only want to be able to input number values).
4. How do I do the sidebar things?
5. What should the homepage look like?
6. How do I do the widget-list page overlapping cogs? What does the triple line thing go to?
